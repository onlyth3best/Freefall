# Freefall
a PCB with an accelerometer… (built with help from https://hermes.hackclub.com/!)
<br/> About the folders: /code has all the code, /prod has all the production files!
<br/> 3d models are in pcb/3dmodels
<br/>
<br/>
The idea is, each LED is linked to a specific direction. For example, left is the first LED, up is the second LED and so on. By 'entering' a the directions into the PCB, you find the combination of directions that make up a certain code!
<br/> note: PCB models are in pcb/kicad! other 3D models that were used were not sourced by me :)
<br/>
<br/> The motivation for this project was mainly to work more on my PCB skills, as well as my ability to read through documentation of a component and get the addresses right. I think that adding the 'code' feature with the lights was also a fun thing I just wanted to add.
<br/>
In terms of code, I haven't fully done the firmware as I don't have the actual thing yet, but here's a guide for setting up the XIAO_RP2040 with Arduino: https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/XIAO-RP2040-with-Arduino/
The firmware I've added is in progress as of now (26/04/26) and I will add setup steps in the future, when I have the physical PCB itself.

# Setup:
<br/> Wiring:
<br/>LED1 = D0
<br/>LED2 = D1
<br/>LED3 = D2
<br/>LED4 = D3
<br/>Accelerometer & Screen = [various, see schematics]
<br/> Cap1 = C1
<br/> Cap2 = C2

<br/>
# Assembly instructions, for now:
<br/>~ Solder these things onto the PCB, according to the schematics:
<br/>~ - XIAO_RP_2040
<br/>~ - four LEDs
<br/>~ - four resistors
<br/>~ - OLED screen
<br/>~ - Accelerometer
<br/>~ - two capacitors
<br/>~ After this, connect the board to the power, this link could help: https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/XIAO-RP2040-with-Arduino/

<br/>also Flash instructions:
<br/> - install ArduinoIDE, https://docs.arduino.cc/software/ide/
<br/> - add the support for the RP2040 (Preferences > Additional Board Manager URLs > "https://github.com/earlephilhower/arduino-pico/releases/download/global/package_rp2040_index.json")
<br/> - connect the XIAO RP_2040 via USB
<br/> - upload the code from this repo in /firmware!
